# Introduction 
Welcome to the README file for Backplane Core, an open-source cloud abstraction API that aims to simplify the complexities of interfacing with multiple public cloud providers. This document provides an overview of the project, its vision, features, key functionality, licensing, and more. 

# Vision 
The vision for Backplane Core is to revolutionize cloud infrastructure management by offering an abstracted Cloud API that eliminates the development complexities associated with interacting with various public cloud providers. By providing a unified, generic, and cloud-agnostic endpoint, Backplane Core enables effortless retrieval of cost, access, and policy data while facilitating the provisioning of diverse cloud environments. 

# Features 
Cloud Abstraction: Backplane Core acts as a central hub for interacting with multiple public cloud providers. Developers can make API calls to Backplane Core, which handles the integration with various cloud service providers, removing the need for individual integration and maintenance efforts. 
Cloud Governance: Backplane Core empowers organizations with robust cloud governance capabilities. It allows efficient management of cost, access, and policies across different cloud environments, providing a holistic view and control. 

# Key Functionality 
Provision Cloud Environments: Backplane Core simplifies the process of provisioning cloud environments. Developers can request the creation of cloud resources through Backplane Core's unified API, abstracting the underlying complexity of different cloud provider APIs. 
Retrieving Cost Data: With Backplane Core, retrieving cost-related data from various cloud providers becomes straightforward. The API offers a standardized method to access cost information, aiding in budgeting and cost optimization. 
Retrieving Policy Data: Backplane Core facilitates the retrieval of policy-related data across multiple cloud platforms. This ensures consistent policy enforcement and compliance across an organization's cloud resources. 
Retrieving Access Data: Managing access permissions across diverse cloud providers is simplified with Backplane Core. It provides a unified interface to retrieve and manage access data, enhancing security and reducing administrative overhead.
